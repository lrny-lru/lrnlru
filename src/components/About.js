                I live in North Carolina, where I've been living for the last 20 years.
             
             
              In 2016, I graduated with my Bachelors of Science in Psychology from Western Carolina University. I've worked in and around this field (in conjunction with social justice) for the last 5 years but I've been in the tech world since I was 3, when I first started using computers.
              
              After spending most of my life around Information Technology, the choice to become a developer felt like a natural progression in my career.  I love that my background as an artist and a psychologist comes together in implementing design and logic. I like to create accessible resources that are also pleasing to the eye. My overarching career goal is to be a helper that others can find when they need me.
             
              Away from coding, I really enjoy new experiences like traveling or trying new food. I also like to do yoga, swim, read and daydream about what's next.
