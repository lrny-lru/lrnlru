              In 2016, I graduated with my Bachelors of Science in Psychology from Western Carolina University. I've worked in and around this field (in conjunction with social justice) for the last 5 years but I've been in the tech world since I was 3, when I first started using computers.

              After spending most of my life around Information Technology, the choice to become a developer felt like a natural progression in my career. I love problem solving with tangible results and I love having the opportunity to be creative and to showcase my attention to detail.
              </p>
              <p>
              Away from coding, I really enjoy new experiences like traveling or trying new food. I also like to do yoga, swim, read and daydream about what's next.
