               <p>
              In 2016, I graduated with my Bachelors of Science in Psychology from Western Carolina University. I've worked in and around this field (in conjunction with social justice) for the last 5 years but I've been in the tech world since I was 3, when I first started using computers.
              </p>
              <p>
              After spending most of my life around Information Technology, the choice to become a developer felt like a natural progression in my career. I love problem solving with tangible results and I love having the opportunity to be creative and to showcase my attention to detail.
              </p>
              <p>
              Away from coding, I really enjoy new experiences like travelling or trying new food. I also like to do yoga, swim, read and daydream about what's next.

            (Me)nses is a wiki dedicated to cultivating up-to-date knowledge on: the menstrual cycle, sex hormones, anatomy and disorders/diseases related to menses without using gendered language. The app was built to be simple
              and quick to use so that symptoms could be tracked easily when
              they happened. Tuck is built using React with Hooks, and Node.js
              with router.

              PMDDTracker is a symptom tracking app for anyone who needs to keep track of symptoms for themselves. PMDDTracker is simplistic, so that the user has less to worry about and can easily enter a symptom without adding any stress to their life. The PMDDTracker app allows users to add a symptom to their  chart, edit symptoms previously added, and delete symptoms.
The app also allows used to view their chart by the severity of their symptoms, or by the date the symptom was added, in order to relay it to a healthcare professional.
Users can add as many details in their description as needed and can view the description of a specific symptom by clicking on the expand icon on their PMDDTracker chart.
PMDDTracker was built with React, using pure CSS and communicates with a live NodeJS/PostgresQL server.

              The Gáidhlig app is a demo application on how to use the spaced
              repetition technique to help study a language, in this case,
              Scottish Gaeic. I built this app to practice using the linked list data
              structure on the back-end with Node.js, and traverse through it
              with algorithms on the front-end with React.
